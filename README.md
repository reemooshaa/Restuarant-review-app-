# Restaurant Reviews App

## Description
Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.


## Project Overview 
In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design must be responsive to different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It will also be added to a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.
